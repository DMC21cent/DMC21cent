<h2>Using Packages with rsconnect</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Deployed applications can depend on any package available on CRAN as well as any package hosted in a public <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> repository.
</p>
<p>When an application is deployed it's source code is scanned for dependencies using the <code><a href="appDependencies.html">appDependencies()</a></code> function. The list of dependencies is sent to the server along with the application source code and these dependencies are then installed alongside the application.
</p>
<p>Note that the <code>Suggests</code> dependencies of packages are not automatically included in the list of dependent packages. See the <em>Note</em> section of the documentation of the <code><a href="appDependencies.html">appDependencies()</a></code> function for details on how to force packages to be included in the dependency list.
</p>


<h3>CRAN Packages</h3>

<p>When sastisfying CRAN package dependencies, the server will build the exact versions of packages that were installed on the system from which the application is deployed.
</p>
<p>If a locally installed package was not obtained from CRAN (e.g. was installed from R-Forge) and as a result doesn't have a version that matches a version previously published to CRAN then an error will occur. It's therefore important that you run against packages installed directly from CRAN in your local configuration.
</p>


<h3>GitHub Packages</h3>

<p>It's also possible to depend on packages hosted in public GitHub repositories, so long as they are installed via the <code><a href="../../devtools/html/remote-reexports.html">devtools::install_github()</a></code> function from the <span class="pkg">devtools</span> package.
</p>
<p>This works because <code>install_github</code> records the exact Github commit that was installed locally, making it possible to download and install the same source code on the deployment server.
</p>
<p>Note that in order for this to work correctly you need to install the very latest version of <code>devtools</code> from Github. You can do this as follows:
</p>
<pre>
  library(devtools)
  install_github("r-lib/devtools")
</pre>
