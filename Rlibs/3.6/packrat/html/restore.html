<h2>Apply the most recent snapshot to the library</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Applies the most recent snapshot to the project's private library.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
restore(project = NULL, overwrite.dirty = FALSE,
  prompt = interactive(), dry.run = FALSE, restart = !dry.run)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>project</code></td>
<td>
<p>The project directory. When in packrat mode, if this is <code>NULL</code>,
then the directory associated with the current packrat project is used. Otherwise,
the project directory specified is used.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>overwrite.dirty</code></td>
<td>
<p>A dirty package is one that has been changed since the
last snapshot or restore. Packrat will leave these alone by default. If you
want to guarantee that <code>restore</code> will put you in the exact state
represented by the snapshot being applied, use <code>overwrite.dirty = TRUE</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>prompt</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>TRUE</code> to prompt before performing potentially destructive
changes (package removals or downgrades); <code>FALSE</code> to perform these
operations without confirmation.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>dry.run</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code>, compute the changes to your packrat state that
would be made if a restore was performed, without actually executing them.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>restart</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code>, restart the R session after restoring.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>restore</code> works by adding, removing, and changing packages so that the
set of installed packages and their versions matches the snapshot exactly.
</p>
<p>There are three common use cases for <code>restore</code>:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>Hydrate</strong>: Use <code>restore</code> after copying a project to a new
machine to populate the library on that machine.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Sync</strong>: Use <code>restore</code> to apply library changes made by a
collaborator to your own library. (In general, you want to run <code>restore</code>
whenever you pick up a change to <code>packrat.lock</code>)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Rollback</strong>: Use <code>restore</code> to undo accidental changes made
to the library since the last snapshot.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p><code>restore</code> cannot make changes to packages that are currently loaded. If
changes are necessary to currently loaded packages, you will need to restart
<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> to apply the changes (<code>restore</code> will let you know when this is
necessary). It is recommended that you do this as soon as possible, because
any library changes made between running <code>restore</code> and restarting <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> will
be lost.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p><code>restore</code> can be destructive; it will remove packages that were not in
the snapshot, and it will replace newer packages with older versions if
that's what the snapshot indicates. <code>restore</code> will warn you before
attempting to remove or downgrade a package (if <code>prompt</code> is
<code>TRUE</code>), but will always perform upgrades and new installations without
prompting.
</p>
<p><code>restore</code> works only on the private package library created by packrat;
if you have other libraries on your path, they will be unaffected.
</p>
<p>The <code>restart</code> parameter will only result in a restart of R when the
R environment packrat is running within makes available a restart function
via <code>getOption("restart")</code>.
</p>
